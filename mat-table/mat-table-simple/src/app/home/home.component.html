<p>Mat-Table</p>

<p>
  The mat-table provides a Material Design styled data-table that can be used to
  display rows of data.
</p>

<p>
  This table builds on the foundation of the CDK data-table and uses a similar
  interface for its data input and template, except that its element and
  attribute selectors will be prefixed with mat- instead of cdk-. For more
  information on the interface and a detailed look at how the table is
  implemented, see the guide covering the CDK data-table.
